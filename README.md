This is the FastAPI backend service for **Lynk**, a minimal, login-free, cross-device file transfer app.

The service coordinates the transfer of files by generating short-lived, presigned upload/download URLs directly to Cloudflare R2 and storing transfer session metadata in Redis. No file bytes are proxied through this server, ensuring high throughput and minimal memory overhead.

## Architecture & Core Features

* **Lifespan Pool Management**: Uses FastAPI's modern `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan handlers to manage connection pools for Redis cleanly.
* **Non-Blocking I/O**: Offloads synchronous S3 `boto3` calls (used for R2 bucket interactions) to background worker threads using `anyio.to_thread.run_sync`.
* **Zero-Knowledge Pathing**: Generates random UUID/cryptographic identifiers for files and transfers. Files are saved in private R2 folders without exposing original names.
* **RFC 5987 Header Sanitation**: Filenames are URL-encoded before generation of download URLs, ensuring emojis and non-ASCII character sets work seamlessly without header injection vulnerabilities.
* **TTL Preservation Rules**: Redis updates are executed dynamically, retrieving and preserving the remaining seconds of a session's lifetime to prevent lifetime extensions.

## API Endpoints

### File Transfers (`/api/v1/transfers`)
* **`POST /transfers`**: Initiates a transfer session, checks file limits, and returns presigned upload URLs.
* **`POST /transfers/{transfer_id}/files/{file_id}/complete`**: Confirms that a file has been successfully uploaded to Cloudflare R2 and updates status.
* **`GET /transfers/{transfer_id}`**: Retrieves transfer metadata (file list, sizes, status, and time-to-live).
* **`POST /transfers/{transfer_id}/downloads`**: Generates presigned download URLs for the files.
* **`DELETE /transfers/{transfer_id}`**: Cancels the transfer and removes files from storage immediately.

### Receiver Sessions (`/api/v1/receiver-sessions`)
* **`POST /receiver-sessions`**: Creates a temporary receiver session (status `"waiting"`) and returns a session ID.
* **`GET /receiver-sessions/{session_id}`**: Polls for session changes (tracks if a transfer has been attached).
* **`POST /receiver-sessions/{session_id}/attach-transfer`**: Attaches a transfer ID to a receiver session (triggers status change to `"attached"`).
* **`DELETE /receiver-sessions/{session_id}`**: Cancels and removes a receiver session.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* Redis Server (running locally on port `6379`)

### Installation
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows Command Prompt:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # Windows PowerShell:
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Local Environment Config
Create a `.env` file in the root of the `backend` folder:
```env
ENVIRONMENT=development
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Optional: Add your actual R2 settings here for real uploads.
# Leaving them blank defaults to local mock configurations.
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-cloudflare-account-id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
R2_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
```

## Running & Testing

* **Start the Server (Reload Mode)**:
  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  ```
  Explore the interactive API docs at **`http://localhost:8000/docs`**.

* **Run the Unit Test Suite**:
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
  ```
  Runs the full suite of 17 tests testing limits, endpoints, completion status, and session allocations.

## Production & Cloud Deployment Notes

When deploying to environments like **Oracle Cloud (OCI)**:
1. **Network Configuration**: Ensure an Ingress Security Rule is added in your OCI console to permit TCP traffic on the port your API is exposed (default `8000`), and save local OS firewall rules (`iptables` / `firewalld`).
2. **Process Management**: Run the app as a background service using **systemd** (`systemctl`) or containerize it via **Docker** to ensure persistent operation and crash recovery.
3. **SSL Reverse Proxy**: Use **Caddy** or **Nginx** in front of the Uvicorn server to automatically provision and manage Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.

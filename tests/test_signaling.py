"""Signaling WebSocket tests — two-party fan-out + late-joiner replay.

Contract (Phases.md): the server is a dumb relay for `offer`, `answer` and
`candidate` JSON between the two peers of a session room. Messages are
buffered per room and replayed to a peer that joins late, so the sender may
signal its offer before the receiver has connected.
